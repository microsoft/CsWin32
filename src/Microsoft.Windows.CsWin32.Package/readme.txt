Microsoft Windows SDK Win32 API Source Generator
==================================================

This package contains a source generator to add a user-defined set of Win32 P/Invoke
methods and supporting types to a C# project.

To get started, create a "NativeMethods.txt" file in your project directory
that lists the names of methods for which you need P/Invoke methods generated, one per line.
