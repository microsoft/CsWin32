# Copilot instructions for this repository

## High level guidance

* Review the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file for instructions to build and test the software.
* Set the `NBGV_GitEngine` environment variable to `Disabled` before running any `dotnet` or `msbuild` commands.

## Software Design

* Design APIs to be highly testable, and all functionality should be tested.
* Avoid introducing binary breaking changes in public APIs of projects under `src` unless their project files have `IsPackable` set to `false`.

## Testing

* There should generally be one test project (under the `test` directory) per shipping project (under the `src` directory). Test projects are named after the project being tested with a `.Test` suffix.
* Tests should use the Xunit testing framework.
* Some tests are known to be unstable. When running tests, you should skip the unstable ones by running `dotnet test --filter "TestCategory!=FailsInCloudTest"`.

## Coding style

* Honor StyleCop rules and fix any reported build warnings *after* getting tests to pass.
* In C# files, use namespace *statements* instead of namespace *blocks* for all new files.
* Add API doc comments to all new public and internal members.
