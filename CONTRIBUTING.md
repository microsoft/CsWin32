## Best practices

* Use Windows PowerShell or [PowerShell Core][pwsh] (including on Linux/OSX) to run .ps1 scripts.
  Some scripts set environment variables to help you, but they are only retained if you use PowerShell as your shell.

## Prerequisites

All dependencies can be installed by running the `init.ps1` script at the root of the repository
using Windows PowerShell or [PowerShell Core][pwsh] (on any OS).
Some dependencies installed by `init.ps1` may only be discoverable from the same command line environment the init script was run from due to environment variables, so be sure to launch Visual Studio or build the repo from that same environment.
Alternatively, run `init.ps1 -InstallLocality Machine` (which may require elevation) in order to install dependencies at machine-wide locations so Visual Studio and builds work everywhere.

The only prerequisite for building, testing, and deploying from this repository
is the [.NET SDK](https://get.dot.net/).
You should install the version specified in `global.json` or a later version within
the same major.minor.Bxx "hundreds" band.
For example if 2.2.300 is specified, you may install 2.2.300, 2.2.301, or 2.2.310
while the 2.2.400 version would not be considered compatible by .NET SDK.
See [.NET Core Versioning](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/versions/) for more information.

## Package restore

The easiest way to restore packages may be to run `init.ps1` which automatically authenticates
to the feeds that packages for this repo come from, if any.
`dotnet restore` or `nuget restore` also work but may require extra steps to authenticate to any applicable feeds.

## Building

This repository can be built on Windows, Linux, and OSX.

Building, testing, and packing this repository can be done by using the standard dotnet CLI commands (e.g. `dotnet build`, `dotnet test`, `dotnet pack`, etc.).

## Parsing the metadata

The win32metadata has [these little "gems"](https://github.com/microsoft/win32metadata/blob/main/docs/projections.md) that CsWin32 should consider consuming to improve the quality of the generated APIs.
When we identify a gem that we should support but do not yet support, file [an issue with a `metadata gem` label](https://github.com/microsoft/CsWin32/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22metadata+gem%22).

## Releases

Use `nbgv tag` to create a tag for a particular commit that you mean to release.
[Learn more about `nbgv` and its `tag` and `prepare-release` commands](https://dotnet.github.io/Nerdbank.GitVersioning/docs/nbgv-cli.html).

Push the tag.

### GitHub Actions

When your repo is hosted by GitHub and you are using GitHub Actions, you should create a GitHub Release using the standard GitHub UI.
Having previously used `nbgv tag` and pushing the tag will help you identify the precise commit and name to use for this release.

After publishing the release, the `.github/workflows/release.yml` workflow will be automatically triggered, which will:

1. Find the most recent `.github/workflows/build.yml` GitHub workflow run of the tagged release.
1. Upload the `deployables` artifact from that workflow run to your GitHub Release.
1. If you have `NUGET_API_KEY` defined as a secret variable for your repo or org, any nuget packages in the `deployables` artifact will be pushed to nuget.org.

### Azure Pipelines

When your repo builds with Azure Pipelines, use the `azure-pipelines/release.yml` pipeline.
Trigger the pipeline by adding the `auto-release` tag on a run of your main `azure-pipelines.yml` pipeline.

## Tutorial and API documentation

API and hand-written docs are found under the `docfx/` directory and are built by [docfx](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/).

You can make changes and host the site locally to preview them by switching to that directory and running the `dotnet docfx --serve` command.
After making a change, you can rebuild the docs site while the localhost server is running by running `dotnet docfx` again from a separate terminal.

The `.github/workflows/docs.yml` GitHub Actions workflow publishes the content of these docs to github.io if the workflow itself and [GitHub Pages is enabled for your repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart).

## Updating dependencies

This repo uses Renovate to keep dependencies current.
Configuration is in the `.github/renovate.json` file.
[Learn more about configuring Renovate](https://docs.renovatebot.com/configuration-options/).

When changing the renovate.json file, follow [these validation steps](https://docs.renovatebot.com/config-validation/).

If Renovate is not creating pull requests when you expect it to, check that the [Renovate GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/renovate) is configured for your account or repo.

## Merging latest from Library.Template

### Maintaining your repo based on this template

The best way to keep your repo in sync with Library.Template's evolving features and best practices is to periodically merge the template into your repo:

```ps1
git fetch
git checkout origin/main
./tools/MergeFrom-Template.ps1
# resolve any conflicts, then commit the merge commit.
git push origin -u HEAD
```
